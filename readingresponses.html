 Reading Notes due 1/25<br>
 Aesthetics of the Internet - Context as a Medium
http://joi.ito.com/weblog/1997/06/19/aesthetics-of-t.html<br>
This reading explores the concept of the internet as this connector and mediator between different forms.The author argues that this platform is best to be viewed as providing context to information rather than the platform being the content itself. It becomes clear that this reading was written in 1997 in that it views the internet as primarily important when it comes to connecting people to each other. This reading states, "most information on the Internet is about context, rather than content. Instead of the hard data of yesteryear that could be bound in a book, stacked in a warehouse and distributed by trucks, the information on the Internet is about being connected live and about being in the right place at the right time.” I think now we can view the internet as being more than for just connecting people, but for allowing programs, data analysis, platforms for creative expression and more. Nowadays, the internet changes the way people view content, so I think it is more than just context. The conversation about the internet is controvercial in and of itself making it part of the news, not just a platform to display the news.  I don't think the information is just a platform for news now; I think the platform itself has become newsworthy and allows for certain interacts and accessibility to take place that couldn't take place prior to the internets development. I appreciated that even when the internet was invented, design aesthetics were already being highly considered; I think the approach of grouping functionality and performance with design at the onset of a development is crucial and it's interesting to think this belief was created at the begging stages of the internet as well.

As We May Think
http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/<br>
The main part of this paper that I find particularly relevant is the idea that "information overload" is a natural causation of a developing world and it is important that we use technology to deal with that. The following quotation really embodies the idea of a more complex world and the need to organization information efficiently: "But there is increased evidence that we are being bogged down today as specialization extends. The investigator is staggered by the findings and conclusions of thousands of other workers—conclusions which he cannot find time to grasp, much less to remember, as they appear. Yet specialization becomes increasingly necessary for progress, and the effort to bridge between disciplines is correspondingly superficial.” It's interesting how this article really groups information as whole together as scientific records; I think that again, shows the date of the article (1945) and how the bulk of information at the time was scientific information. It seems as though this article is talking about difficult processes, like developing film, repetitive math, etc. and the author believes that these sometimes, mundane tasks, could be made more efficient by the development of some technology. I think the bulk of the article can be summarized in this quotation: "He has built a civilization so complex that he needs to mechanize his records more fully if he is to push his experiment to its logical conclusion and not merely become bogged down part way there by overtaxing his limited memory. “ This article was forward thinking in that if we are going to develop more things, we need to make sure we have the systems in place to continue to make technology more purposeful, effective, and meaningful.
