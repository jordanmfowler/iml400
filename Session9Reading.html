<div>I am so fascinated with UX so much so that this is the field I want to go in to in the future so I have such an appreciation for Don Norman. I truly think that this discipline will have its own place in every business in the future. I also think that critical making is a methodology that all businesses will have to adapt if they want to stay in front of the curve. The reading by Matt Ratto about critical making expresses how the goal of critical making isn’t necessarily for the end user, but it is a methodology or a procedure to help those designers reach new heights and observations through a hands on approach. </div>

<div>I learned a lot in this reading about the different types of innovation. There is radical innovation such as creating a telephone or there is more incremental innovation, which is more regarding the release of an update for an already existing technology or platform. I think he makes a great point in that in our society and in academia, we keep teaching radical innovation, when really incremental innovation happens more often and is perhaps even more solid because it is building on platforms that we know already work.</div>

<div>Norman expresses how websites have personalities and this very closely relates to the last two readings, which express how humans are at the center of every innovation and design and humans drive the tech with their emotions, bias, good ideas and even bad ideas. On this note, this reading linked to another one of Norman’s writings in Core 77 about his take on design thinking. He talks about how what makes design consultancies successful is because they can offer an outside look on an idea and provide something fresh and new. He talks about how design thinking aka creative thinking isn’t something that should be left up to designers (although its good it does because it gives them their niche), but instead it should be done by people in all fields and not just those that are labeled as designers. I loved learning about these topics and hope to take advantage of them in my future critical making projects!</div>
