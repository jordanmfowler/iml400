  <strong>About</strong><br>
I'm Jordan! Here I am 21 years down this road called life and as my Jamaican heritage would say, everything is irie. I'm surrounded by the best team of people made of family, friends, co-workers, and supporters. I'm so fortunate to be at my dream university, USC, involved in activities that are changing my life while immersing myself in an academic field that has the power to change the world. I'll continue to pray for more hours in the day and days in the week because there are so many things I want to accomplish. Most of the time you can find me on campus, but when I'm not there I'm likely to be at the nearest food hot spot indulging on a great meal.

My mission is to use my passion for people, technology, and innovation to design a better world for others. I'm enjoying my journey one day at a time.

  <strong>Technical and Design Strengths</strong><br>
  I love technology and I love it even more when I am taught it by somebody who is patient and willing to go slow. Coding can be frusturating and overwhelming enough as is, so it means a lot when a professor is willing to go slow to minimize the anxiety and isolation that coding can made me feel. My favorite parts of coding are the design aspects as well as the UX aspects. I loved reading Steven Krug's <em>Don't Make Me Think </em> as it helped me understand what elements can make a website go from decent to professor, effective practical. I love wireframing and working in groups to make projects as great as they can be!

  <strong>What you hope to learn from this class</strong><br>
    In this class, I hope to become more confident in my coding abilities. I hope to learn more about the possibilities of the internet as well as learn more industry standards when it comes to this industry. I am very hopeful and excited for this class based on everything I have heard!

      Spirit Animal: The owl spirit animal is emblematic of a deep connection with wisdom and intuitive knowledge. If you have the owl as totem or power animal, you're likey to have the ability to see what's usually hidden to most.
